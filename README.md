# Video Game C++

In this repository there are two games, one in 2D made with C++ and OpenGL and the other one is in 3D and made with Unity.
The games are made in the context of a Project in the Subject of "Videojocs" in the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Barcelona.

Here is the subject web page. <a href="https://www.cs.upc.edu/~jalonso/vj/"> Click here </a>
